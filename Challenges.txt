Challenges/Lessons

1. Changes were not getting committed - Commit Staged in VS was disabled

Solution - We needed to install GIT for Windows - which added it to PATH using which VS looks it up.
This step in the setup should be checked - ✔ Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software

2. GUID as PK and some other column for clustering possible!

3. Single node DB - Having different components of a database like storage engine, query processor, transaction manager run on the same server - physical or virtual. Preferred for smaller apps - development and testing stages where high availability, scalability and fault tolerance are not critical concerns.

3. What is fault tolerance ? Fault tolerance in distributed systems is the ability to maintain continuous operation and service despite failures (hardware, software, network) in one or more components, ensuring high availability, reliability, and data integrity through strategies like redundancy, replication, and error detection to prevent single points of failure

If a concept can change over time, it does NOT belong in an identity enum.
