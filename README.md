# flow-track-app
An attempt at real world application from scratch

# Vision
To learn as much as possible intentionally from this project implementation about e2e aspects of a real-world application.
To become more confident on the performance of my job.
To become more risk-taking and make myself confortable with experimentation.

# Problem statement
FlowTrack is a hybrid work management platform offering both individual and organization-level capabilities. 
The system is designed with explicit tenant isolation, license-aware authorization, customizable and auditability as 
first-class concerns.
FlowTrack focuses on user experience and intuitive design.
We are aiming to keep the architecture future proof.
